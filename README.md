## Description  
Using the google books API, you can search for book titles and save them to your own list. The list of books is stored in a Mongo database along with your user credentails.  
User passwords are 'hashed' before storing and a cripted token is kepy whilst the user is logged in.  
This app has been refactored from the origional and now uses Apollo Server and graphql.
